## **Description** 
#### This development was built on top of the GitHub API. Using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The main objective is to search for a user using this API. If the user is not found, they will be redirected to an error page, where they can return to the main page. Also, if the user has no repositories, the page will display a message indicating no repositories were found.

##### The goal of this project was to put into practice everything learned in the course about API usage, array methods, and local storage.
